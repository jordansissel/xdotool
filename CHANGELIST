KNOWN ISSUES:
  - OSX: windowmove in OSX/X11 default WM incorrectly reports or accepts window
    position.  The coordinates of a window's current position cannot be used to
    correctly place the window. Normally, window managers are supposed to
    report reserved window extents in the property list of the root window
    (say, for the OS X menu bar), but OS X's default X11 wm does not do this.
    If this affects you, please let me know and I will attempt to fix it.

FOR TODO LIST, SEE TODO FILE :)

3.20180106.1
  - added 'return' -> 'Return', 'enter' -> 'Return'  mappings in xdo_util
    to eliminate user gotchas not in man page.
    removed extraneous '+' chars in version.sh; already present in DATE_FMT
    (CSylvain)

3.20160805.1
  - Fix release tool problem. cflags.sh was missing from the previous two
    releases. 
    `make test-package-build` now works correctly on OSX 10.11 and Fedora 23.

3.20160804.2
  - Fix some bugs in the Makefile especially for OS X / macOS Sierra 
    (Misty De Meo)

3.20160804.1
  - Fix compilation problems on OSX 10.12 aka macOS Sierra. (#138; Jordan
    Sissel and Misty De Meo)
  - Fix memory leaks in window search and charcode map lookups (Markus Roth)
  - xdotool selectwindow (xdo_select_window_with_click) now only selects the
    window if mouse button 1 is pressed. Any other buttons will cause this
    selection to be aborted. (#136, #137; Jordan Sissel and Yuri D'Elia)
  - Fix bug where `xdotool click` with --clearmodifiers can sometimes leave
    stuck keys or mouse buttons. (#102, Aurelien Lourot)
  - windowmove now supports coordinates as a percentage of screen size. For
    example, a move to 50% 50% would move the window such that the top-left
    corner of the window is in the center of the screen. (#92, #27; Collin
    Guarino)
  - Typing commands (key and type) will now try to use XTEST instead of
    XSendEvent in a special circumstance. If the window id given (by window
    stack or the --window flag) is the currenly-focused window, key sequences
    will be sent using XTEST. (#85, mpnolan)
  - getmouselocation, getwindowgeometry, and search commands: now supports
    --shell and --prefix for having stdout be consumable by bash or similar
    shells. (#80, yatsek)
  - xdotool scripts such as running via `xdotool -` will now execute commands
    as lines of input are read. The previous behavior waited until stdin closed
    before executing anything. (#131, abensj)

3.20150503
  - Lots of changes over the past 4 years, but with many folks telling me to do
    another release tarball, here it is.
    We can backfill the changelog later.

2.20110530.*
  - New set_window feature: --urgency. This lets you set the urgency flag on a
    window Window managers will interpret this as something about your window
    needing attention. It might flash in the taskbar, pop up, or other.
    Original patch and suggestion by ervandew.
    Issue: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=39
  - New function: xdo_window_seturgency (see above)
  - Hack in OS X support as it is missing a proper clock_gettime.
    Should fix http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=37
    Reported by ryandesign.com
  - Add support for typing UTF-8 characters. Patch from Joseph Krahn.
  - Make all output call fflush to send data immediately (for pipes). Reported
    by Andreas Wagner on the mailing list.
  - Make 'get_desktop_viewport' output usable with 'set_desktop_viewport'
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=47
  - You can now make 'libxdo.a' for embedding libxdo into your binary
    (Requested by psc on the mailing list).
  - Fixed a typing bug where the keymap changes unnecessarily 
  - Should now build cleanly in C++ environments (Reported by psc on the
    mailing list)
  - bugfix: xdotool should use command names first before trying file scripts. 
    See https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=938309 for original report.
  - Add a 'sleep' command. (Requested by Joseph Krahn via mailing list)
  - Add --relative flag to windowmove. (Requested by Anthony Thyssen via mailing
  - Add --desktop flag to the search command. This lets you search for windows
    on specific desktop. Requires a window manager that supports multiple
    desktops in a way that EWMH supports.
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=38
  - Add --limit flag to search. This allows you to break the search early after
    a certain number of matches. (Requested by Anthony Thyssen)
  - New command 'getwindowgeometry' for fetching window position and size
    (Requested by Anthony Thyssen via mailing list)
  - Add --sync flag to search command; blocks until results are found.
    xdotool will search every 0.5 seconds for results.
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=42
  - windowmove can now move windows along an axis. Give literal 'x' or 'y'
    instead of a coordinate and it uses the current position. (Requested by
    etnlIcarus via mailing list)
  - Add '--args N' and '--terminator TERMINATOR' to the 'exec' command.
    Default terminator unless specified (or --args is) is ':' (Requested by
    Joseph Krahn and Henning Bekel via mailing list)
  - set_desktop now supports --relative flag (+N or -N to move relative)
    (Requested by Anthony Thyssen)
  - The mouse cursor now changes during 'xdotool selectwindow' (Requested by
    Anthony Thyssen via mailing list)
  - Added '--args N' and '--terminator TERMINATOR' to the 'type' command.
  - Add 'getdisplaygeometry' command for querying the size of your screen.
    (Requested by @rrwo via twitter)
  - Add xdo_get_viewport_dimensions function.
 
2.20101012.*
  - New command: 'windowminimize' for minimizing windows. If you want to
    unminimize a window, use 'windowactivate'.
  - New command: 'behave_screen_edge' to attach commands to edge and corner
    activities. For example, to lock your screen when the mouse hits the
    top-right corner for more than 2 seconds:
      xdotool behave_screen_edge --delay 2000 top-right exec xscreensaver-command -lock
    'xscreensaver-command' comes with the xscreensaver package.
  - New command: 'exec' for executing commands. Useful with behave_screen_edge.
  - Bug fix: Catch pointer grab failures in selectwindow (xdo_window_select)
    and abort if we can't grab it and report an error message.
  - Add  --delay and --repeat flags to click. This allows you to easily
    double-click (or more) in a single command. Requested by meenakshi sundaram
    via the mailing list.
  - Add new option to mouse move 'restore'. This will restore the mouse position
    to the last known position prior to the most recent move. That is:
      xdotool mousemove 0 0 mousemove restore
    the above will move the mouse to 0,0 then move the mouse back to the
    position it was before. Requested by luc le rumeur and suffian amjad on the
    mailing list.
  - Add 'static' and 'install-static' targets. Requested by Anthony Thyssen on
    the mailing list.
  - Fix bug in xdotool getmouselocation that didn't search for the client window
    correctly.
  - New function: xdo_mousewindow, which lets you get the window the mouse is
    currently over.
  - New function: xdo_mouselocation2, which is an extended version of
    xdo_mouselocation and includes the window the mouse is currently over.
  - New function: xdo_window_minimize, which minimizes a window.
  - Add patch from Henning Bekel that greatly improves xdotool's script
    feature. Scripts now no longer invoke /bin/sh for each line, but instead
    build a command chain to execute. Further, positional arguments ($1, $2,
    etc) and environment variables ($FOO, $WINDOWID, etc) work as expected
    despite the removal of /bin/sh.

2.20100818.*
  - New commands: 'get_desktop_viewport' and 'set_desktop_viewport'. Some
    window managers don't actually do 'multiple desktops' but instead show
    workspaces as views on a large desktop. For example, Compiz Fusion does
    this, which is why you may see 4 or more desktops, but 'xdotool
    get_num_desktops' reports only one.
  - New command: 'selectwindow' command which picks a window by clicking on it.
  - New command: 'windowreparent' with original patch by Markus Opitz.
  - New command: 'windowkill' will kill a window and the client that owns it
    (via XKillClient)
  - New command: 'getwindowname' for printing the name (title) of a window.
    Requested by Dominik Reichl for KeePass.
  - New command: 'behave'. This allows you to run xdotool commands on window
    events. For example, you can achieve 'mouse-follows-focus' with this:
      xdotool search --class xterm behave %@ mouse-enter windowfocus
    This will find all xterms and, upon mouse entering, will focus that window.
    Not really sure what I wanted with this feature, but it can grow as needed.
  - Support percentages in 'windowsize'. Percentages are relative to the size
    of the screen the window is on. 'windowsize 12345 100% 50%' will make the 
    window the full width and half height of the screen.
  - When typing, if we can't find a character in the existing keymap, try
    looking up in keysym_charmap (xdo_util.h) and binding a key if we find one
    that matches. Reported by Victor Baulac on the mailing list. This allows
    us to type '@', for example, even if the current keymap does not have
    this key.

2.20100701.*:
  - No functional changes.
  - Add missing file 'Doxyfile' to the release package so the xdo docs can be
    built from a release tarball. (Reported by Daniel Kahn Gillmor)
  - Skip 'getwindowfocus' misc test if we don't have a windowmanager due to
    a bug/feature in Xvfb and Xephyr if there is only one client and no wm.

2.20100623.*:
  - Added 'window stack' and 'command chaining' support. Basically lets you
    include multiple commands on a single xdotool invocation and saves the last
    window result from search, getactivewindow, and getwindowfocus. For example,
    the default window selector is "%1" meaning the first window. 'xdotool
    search --class xterm windowsize 500 500' will resize the first xterm found.
    All commands that take window arguments (as flags or otherwise) now default to
    "%1" if unspecified. See xdotool(1) manpage sections 'COMMAND CHAINING'
    and 'WINDOW STACK' for more details. This feature was suggested (with great
    detail) by Henning Bekel.
  - To simplify command chaining, all options now terminate at the first
    non-option argument. See getopt(3) near 'POSIXLY_CORRECT' for details.
  - Add --sync support to windowsize.
  - Update docs and output to indicate that 'search --title' is deprecated (but
    still functions). Use --name instead.
  - Fix mousemove --screen problem due to bug in XTEST. Reported by
    Philipp Specht, http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=35
  - Fix segfault when invoking xdotool with an invalid command.
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=34
    Reported by: Bruce Jerrick, Sven Lankes, Daniel Kahn Gillmor, and Thomas
    Schwery.
  - Fix bug --clearmodifiers bug caused by an uninitialized value being
    interpreted as the 'modmask' causing us to try to clear invalid modifiers.
    Reported by Hong-Leong Ong on the mailing list.
  - Lots of internal refactoring and documentation improvements.
  - Testing additions for several commands in addition to command chaining.
  - Documented libxdo through xdo.h. Docs can be generated by 'make docs'
    from the xdotool release.
  - libxdo: xdo_window_translate_with_sizehint
  - libxdo: xdo_window_wait_for_size

2.20100602.*:
  - testing fix: Make mouse movement tests more tolerant of slight variations.

2.20100601.*:
  - Add --sync and --clearmodifiers support to mousemove_relative
  - Fix bug in mousemove_relative --polar (Reported by Paul S via mailing list)
  - Change polar coordinates to be 'north'-oriented (0 is up, 90 is right...)
    (Requested by Paul S via mailing list)
  - Changed xdotool search flags. '--title' now means '--name' to match the
    window name (shown in the window manager title bar for the window).
    Related: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=33
    --title still works, but you will get a warning about deprecation.
  - Walked through all commands and tried to make sure the manpage reflects
    reality and has more detail where needed.

2.20100525.*:
  - Skip certain tests when the requirements aren't met (ie; no such window manager, etc)
    Reported by Daniel Kahn Gillmor.

2.20100524.*:
  - Make search --name search the window title, not the classname
  - Add --sync flag to many commands. This flag will make any supporting command
    block until the operation completes. For example, a 'windowmove --sync' will
    only exit once the window has moved. Commands supported:
    * windowactivate
    * windowfocus
    * windowmap
    * windowmove
    * windowunmap
  - Fix http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=21
    Multiple keyboard layouts are now supported better. Added unit tests
    to ensure consistency in typing across releases.
  - Added polar coordinate support to mouse movement. 'mousemove' and
    'mousemove_relative' support this. Flag is --polar. 'x' becomes angle (degrees)
    and 'y' becomes distance. The default origin is screen center. If you specify
    a window (to mousemove) then the origin is the center of that window.
    Requested by Paul S on the xdotool-users mailing list.
  - internal: Reworked testing to be less flakey
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=30
  - internal: split commands into one per C file
  - API changes that required a version bump.
    * xdo_keysequence and friends now take a delay.
  - New libxdo functions:
    * xdo_window_wait_for_map_state
    * xdo_window_wait_for_active
    * xdo_get_window_location
    * xdo_window_wait_for_focus


1.20100415.*:
  - Add support for searching classnames (not just class)
  - Support switched xkbmaps. We do this by checking if the keycode found for a keysym
    has that keysym as the first or second (normal or with shift-key) mapping, if not
    we pretend we didn't find it and request it be bound as if the keysym wasn't mapped
    to any key.

    This is a hack to avoid knowing what other modifiers are required to type
    keysyms mapped at indexes 2 or beyond (0 is normal, 1 is shift, 2 and beyond
    are unknown).
    Verified fixes this: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=13
    Should fix some of this: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=21
  - Add --shell flag to getmouselocation. This will output data you can safely
    eval in your shell.
  - Add platform detection for Darwin when building.
    Should fix: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=28

1.20100325.*:
  - Fix bug in search where --name wasn't working. Test written to cover this.
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=25

1.20100318.*:
  - Bug fixes only this release
  - Rewrote tests to use ruby and will now test against Xvfb and Xephyr using:
    no window manager, openbox, and then gnome.
  - Fix build problems on Arch linux (or gentoo?)
    Fixes: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=20
  - Fix searching for only visible windows.
    Fixes: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=22
  - Fix xdotool search flags: --title, --name, --class
  - Add include for keysym.h to fix compile errors reported on the mailing
    list.

1.20100302.*:
  - Some test fixes suggested by Daniel Kahn Gillmor
  - Don't use isatty(0) anymore as it isn't totally reliable in determining if
    we should try to read from stdin.

1.20100301.*:
  - Minor libxdo patch to avoid exporting unnecessary symbols (Daniel Kahn
    Gillmor)
  - Minor Makefile fix to only link libxdo (and not xdotool) against libX11 and
    libXtst (also Daniel Kahn Gillmor)
  - Some test cleanup patches by Daniel Kahn Gillmor
  - Fixed the 'type hello' test that would fail sometimes when run in Xephyr. 
  - Fix a minor bug in xdo_window_setclass that incorrectly aborts when
    XGetClassHint fails.

1.20100227.*:
  - Bump major version since there were lots of libxdo changes (now
    libxdo.so.1)
  - Support '--pid NUM' for searching for windows by pid:
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=10
    Example: xdotool search --pid 12345
    Example: xdotool search --pid 12345 "hello world"
  - Add 'xdotool getwindowpid' command to get the pid that owns a window.
  - Add --window to xdotool mousemove, click, mousedown, and mouseup
  - Add --screen to xdotool mousemove
  - The --clearmodifiers flag now clears mouse buttons, too.
    Part of http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=6
  - The --clearmodifiers flag now clears caps lock.
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=4
  - Have 'make install' create all required directories
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=17
  - Support multiple screens in searches. Default is to search all screens.
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=11
    Example: 'xdotool search --screen N' specifies a single screen to search.
  - Support reading a list of xdotool commands via stdin or a file. Usages:
    * read from stdin:
      xdotool -
    * read from stdin (use isatty(0) to detect redirection): 
      xdotool < somefile    
    * An executable script also works when it has this at the top:
      #!/path/to/xdotool

0.20100118.*:
  - Slight change in how we present versions. Now versions have major, date,
    and svn revision. The main addition was to add the major which maps to the
    libxdo library abi version (libxdo.so.0).
  - Add 'xdotool version' for querying version
  - libxdo now has xdo_version function for fetching the library version.
  - Allow typing keys that are not mapped to any keyboard button. 
    For example, you can type the euro symbol like this, even if you don't have
    a key on your keyboard that can do it:
      xdotool key EuroSign
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=16
  - Fixed some pod errors in the manpage

20091231.03:
  - Fix regression in 'windowsize' command: --useflags stopped being accepted,
    now works again. Reported by Evangelos Foutras in bug/issue #15.

20091231.02:
  No functional changes.
  - fix linking problems and just use $(CC) for build and linking
  - Make the tests headless (requires Xvfb and GNOME)
  - Make the t/run.sh test runner exit-code friendly

20091231.01:
  No xdotool changes.
  libxdo changes:
    * Rename keysymcharmap -> keysym_charmap
    * Expose keysym_charmap and symbol_map as xdo_keysym_charmap() 
      and xdo_symbol_map()

20091210.01:
  * No functional changes.
  * Added a few patches from Russel Harmon which:
    + fix some memory leaks
    + add use of getopt in all the command functions
    + some makefile fixes
    + accept more variations of someone asking for help (-help and --help)

20091210:
  * No functional changes.
  * Added 'soname' (shared library name/version) to libxdo.so for better
    linkage. This change may break linking with non-gnu ld(1), I don't know.

20091208:
  * Added documentation about 'search --maxdepth' and new command 'set_window'
  * Added building of libxdo.so so other tools can link against it. This
    change requested by Debian:
      http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=560103

20090815:
  * Incorporate patch from Henning Bekel which adds a new ability to change
    window properties such as window name, icon name, class, role, etc.
    New command: xdotool set_window
  * Add --maxdepth to 'xdotool search' to limit the traversal depth

20090710:
  * You can clear keyboard modifiers during typing now with --clearmodifiers
    When used, this flag causes physical keyboard modifiers (alt, control, etc)
    that are currently active to be ignored during typing.
    This is supported in: xdotool key, keyup, keydown, and type.
    
    Example: 
      xdotool type 'hello world' results in 'HELLO WORLD' while holding shift.
      xdotool type --clearmodifiers 'hello world' results in 'hello world'
        regardless of you holding shift.

    The 'reset' only happens at the beginning of typing and the modifiers are
    restored at the end. If you press a modifier key *during* typing it will 
    act as if --clearmodifiers was not present.
    (http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=6)

  * You can now specify literal keycodes for any key command.
    Example: xdotool key 38   (types 'a' with my keyboard)
    (requested via mailing list)

  * Regression fix: 'xdotool type' now properly obeys capitalization, again.
  * Bug fix: 'xdotool key --window' now works properly

20090612:
  * Fixed bug where shift modifier was not reset when 'xdotool type' used.
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=5

20090609:
  * Add '--delay <delay_in_ms>' to xdotool type. Sets the delay between keys.
  * Add '--window <windowid>' to xdotool type, key, keyup, and keydown.
    This feature (key events with --window <windowid>) only works if the
    application does not reject X events that have 'send_event' set to true.

    Special notes:
    * Firefox appears to ignore all input when it does not have focus.
    * xterm ignores sendevent by default, ctrl+leftclick menu will let you
      enable it.
    * gnome-terminal appears to accept send_event input by default


20090330:
  * Fix bug where we use the wrong type in sizeof() for allocating character
    code map.
  * Fix tiny problem where we would try to free() an invalid pointer

20090126:
  * Change the default behavior of 'getwindowfocus' to get the first
    ancestor-or-self window that has WM_CLASS set. WM_CLASS will be set on
    (all?) top-level windows and it's possible that the currently focused
    window according to X is not a top-level window. To use the previous
    behavior, use 'getwindowfocus -f'
  * Make 'xdotool key at' work correctly. 'at' is usually Shift+2, for example.
    Now all shifted characters should work, but I've only tested on a US
    keyboard.
  * Minor Makefile fixes for package maintainers.

20080720:
  * Add 'getmouselocation' which outputs the coordinate of the mouse cursor and
    the screen number the mouse is on.
  * Add 'getactivewindow' which uses NETWM to query the active window; this is
    often more reliable than 'getwindowfocus' assuming your window manager
    supports it
  * Fix typos in the documentation.

20080716:
  * Fix return codes in xdo_keysequence() and other functions

20080606:
  * Correctly report an error if xdotool is invoked with an invalid command.
  * Fix invalid error code reporting from 'windowraise'

20080603:
  * Daniel Kahn Gillmor reported a problem with return codes from xdotool. All
    commands return proper exit status now (0 == success, nonzero == error)
  * I tested on 3 window managers: Gnome2 2.20.0, OpenBox 3.4, ion-3rc-20070608
    - Gnome and OpenBox pass all tests.
    - ion-3 fails on any desktop-related methods (ion-3 lacks the support).

20080601:
  * Add new commands:
    - windowactivate: Activate a window. If the window is on another desktop,
      we will switch to that desktop and then activate the window.
    - set_num_desktops number: Changes the number of desktops or workspaces.
    - get_num_desktops: Output the current number of desktops.
    - set_desktop desktop_number: Change the current view to the specified
        desktop.
    - get_desktop: Output the current desktop in view.
    - set_desktop_for_window window_id desktop_number: Move a window to a
        different desktop.
    - get_desktop_for_window window_id: Output the desktop currently containing
        the given window.

    windowactivate tested and confirmed working in: ion-3 and Gnome2 (metacity)
    The rest of the new commands have only been tested in Gnome2. They do not
    work in ion-3 due to lacking support for EWMH in ion.
  * Rewrote the man page in perlpod format.

20080521:
  * Import patches from keynav's xdotool branch (From Lukas Mai) which make
    xdotool compile happily when building with -Wall and -pedantic (and others)
  * Finally convert to using Window type for (hopefully) everything instead of
    incorrectly typecasting Window to int sometimes.
  * Confirmed that the one (but mostly useless) test passes.

20071230:
  * Manpage contribution by Daniel Kahn Gillmor
  * Add COPYRIGHT from svn to the distributed package.

20070903:
  * Add xdo_mousemove_relative for relative mouse movements
  * Add xdolib.sh. This is a script library to help with features xdo does not
    explicitly implement, such as querying window attributes, or fetching the
    root window id. An example which uses this is: examples/move_window_away.sh

20070812:
  * Magnus Boman contributed keysequence_{up,down} adding new commands to
    xdotool: keyup and keydown. These take the same arguments as 'key' but only
    send keyup or keydown events.
  * Lee Pumphret contributed getwindowfocus, which tells you the window id of
    the window currently holding focus.
  * Removed 'Makefile.no-pkg-config' because the original Makefile now knows
    how to build for both cases: with and without pkg-config.

20070722:
  * Compiles without warnings when using gcc -Wall now
  * Fixed false error reporting due to some functions missing return statements

20070713:
  * Add flag SIZE_USEHINTS to xdo_window_setsize
  * Add flag --usehints to xdotool windowsize

  Increments are used often in terminals that say "my font is 5 by 7 pixels, so
  resize by that increment". So, you can use this to set a terminal to be 80x24
  characters instead of pixels. Verified by resizing xterm and gnome-terminal
  (with menus enabled).

20070712:
  Added new search options to 'xdotool search'
    --onlyvisible shows only visible windows in the results
    --title causes only the window title to be matched
    --name causes the window name to be matched
    --class causes the window class to be matched

  For information on names and classes, check out the xprop tool.
    For example, for an xterm you will see this in the xprop output:
    WM_CLASS(STRING) = "xterm", "XTerm"
  "xterm" is the name, "XTerm" is the class. Don't ask me what the differences
  are supposed to be. ;)
