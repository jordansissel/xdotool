=head1 NAME

xdotool - command-line X11 automation tool

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<xdotool> I<cmd> I<args...>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xdotool> lets you programatically (or manually) simulate keyboard input and
mouse activity, move and resize windows, etc. It does this using X11's
XTEST extension and other Xlib functions.

There is some support for Extended Window Manager Hints (aka EWMH or NetWM).
See the L</EXTENDED WINDOW MANAGER HINTS> section for more information.

=head1 KEYBOARD COMMANDS

=over

=item B<key> I<[options]> I<keystroke> [I<keystroke> ...]

Options:

=over

=item B<--window window> 

Send keystrokes to a specific window id. . You can use
L<WINDOW STACK> references like "%1" and "%@" here. If there is a window stack,
then "%1" is the default, otherwise the current window is used.

See also: L<SENDEVENT NOTES> and L<WINDOW STACK>

=item B<--clearmodifiers> 

Clear modifiers before sending keystrokes. See L<CLEARMODIFIERS> below.

=item B<--delay milliseconds> 

Delay between keystrokes. Default is 12ms.

=back

Type a given keystroke. Examples being "alt+r", "Control_L+J",
"ctrl+alt+n", "BackSpace".

Generally, any valid X Keysym string will work. Multiple keys are
separated by '+'. Aliases exist for "alt", "ctrl", "shift", "super",
and "meta" which all map to Foo_L, such as Alt_L and Control_L, etc.

In cases where your keyboard doesn't actually have the key you want to type,
xdotool will automatically find an unused keycode and use that to type the key.

With respect to L<COMMAND CHAINING>, this command consumes the remainder of the
arguments or until a new xdotool command is seen, because no xdotool commands
are valid keystrokes.

Example: Send the keystroke "F2"
 xdotool key F2

Example: Send 'a' with an accent over it (not on english keyboards, but still
works with xdotool)
 xdotool key Aacute

Example: Send ctrl+l and then BackSpace as separate keystrokes:
 xdotool key ctrl+l BackSpace

Example: Send ctrl+c to all windows matching title 'gdb' (See L<COMMAND CHAINING>)
 xdotool search --name gdb key ctrl+c

=item B<keydown> I<[options]> I<keystroke>

Same as above, except only keydown events are sent.

=item B<keyup> I<keystroke>

Same as above, except only keyup events are sent.

=item B<type> I<[options]> I<something to type>

Options:

=over

=item B<--window windowid> 

Send keystrokes to a specific window id. See L<SENDEVENT NOTES> below. The
default, if no window is given, depends on the window stack. If the window
stack is empty the current window is typed at using XTEST. Otherwise, the
default is "%1" (see L<WINDOW STACK>).

=item B<--delay milliseconds> 

Delay between keystrokes. Default is 12ms.

=item B<--clearmodifiers> 

Clear modifiers before sending keystrokes. See L<CLEARMODIFIERS> below.

=back

Types as if you had typed it. Supports newlines and tabs (ASCII newline and
tab). Each keystroke is separated by a delay given by the delay option.

With respect to L<COMMAND CHAINING>, this command consumes the remainder of the
arguments and types them. That is, no commands can chain after 'type'.

Example: to type 'Hello world!' you would do:
 xdotool type 'Hello world!'

=back

=head1 MOUSE COMMANDS

=over 

=item B<mousemove> I<[options]> I<x> I<y>

Move the mouse to the specific X and Y coordinates on the screen.

=over

=item B<--window WINDOW> 

Specify a window to move relative to. Coordinates 0,0
are at the top left of the window you choose.

L<WINDOW STACK> references are valid here, such as %1 and %@. Though, using %@
probably doesn't make sense.

=item B<--screen SCREEN>

Move the mouse to the specified screen to move to. This is only useful if you
have multiple screens and ARE NOT using Xinerama.

The default is the current screen. If you specify --window, the --screen flag
is ignored.

=item B<--polar> 

Use polar coordinates. This makes 'x' an angle (in degrees, 0-360, etc) and 'y'
the distance.

Rotation starts at 'up' (0 degrees) and rotates clockwise: 90 = right, 180 =
down, 270 = left.

The origin defaults to the center of the current screen. If you specify a --window, 
then the origin is the center of that window.

=item B<--clearmodifiers> 

See L<CLEARMODIFIERS>

=item B<--sync> 

After sending the mouse move request, wait until the mouse is actually
moved. If no movement is necessary, we will not wait. This is useful for
scripts that depend on actions being completed before moving on.

Note: We wait until the mouse moves at all, not necessarily that it
actually reaches your intended destination. Some applications lock the 
mouse cursor to certain regions of the screen, so waiting for any movement is
better in the general case than waiting for a specific target.

=back

=item B<mousemove_relative> [options] I<x> I<y>

Move the mouse x,y pixels relative to the current position of the mouse cursor.

=over 

=item B<--polar> 

Use polar coordinates. This makes 'x' an angle (in degrees, 0-360, etc) and 'y'
the distance.

Rotation starts at 'up' (0 degrees) and rotates clockwise: 90 = right, 180 =
down, 270 = left.

=item B<--sync>

After sending the mouse move request, wait until the mouse is actually
moved. If no movement is necessary, we will not wait. This is useful for
scripts that depend on actions being completed before moving on.

Note that we wait until the mouse moves at all, not necessarily that it
actually reaches your intended destination. Some applications lock the 
mouse cursor to certain regions of the screen, so waiting for any movement is
better in the general case than waiting for a specific target.

=item B<--clearmodifiers> 

See L<CLEARMODIFIERS>

=back

=item B<click> I<[options]> I<button>

Send a click, that is, a mousedown followed by mouseup for the given button
with a short delay between the two (currently 12ms).

Buttons generally map this way: Left mouse is 1, middle is 2, right is 3,
wheel up is 4, wheel down is 5.

=over

=item B<--clearmodifiers> 

Clear modifiers before clicking. See L<CLEARMODIFIERS> below.

=item B<--window> WINDOW 

Specify a window to send a click to. See L<SENDEVENT NOTES> below for caveats. Uses the
current mouse position when generating the event.

The default, if no window is given, depends on the window stack. If the window
stack is empty the current window is typed at using XTEST. Otherwise, the
default is "%1" (see L<WINDOW STACK>).

=back

=item B<mousedown> I<[options]> I<button>

Same as B<click>, except only a mouse down is sent.

=item B<mouseup> I<[options]> I<button>

Same as B<click>, except only a mouse up is sent.

=item B<getmouselocation> I<[--shell]>

Outputs the x, y, and screen location of the mouse cursor. Screen numbers will
be nonzero if you have multiple monitors and are not using Xinerama.

=over

=item B<--shell>

This makes getmouselocation output shell data you can eval. Example:

 % xdotool getmouselocation --shell
 X=880
 Y=443
 SCREEN=0

 % eval $(xdotool getmouselocation --shell)
 % echo $X,$Y
 714,324

=back

=back

=head1 WINDOW COMMANDS

=over

=item B<search> I<[options]> I<pattern>

Search for windows with titles, names, or classes with a regular expression
pattern. The output is line-delimited list of X window identifiers. If you
are using L<COMMAND CHAINING>, the L<search> command will only write window
ids to stdout if it is the last (or only) command in the chain; otherwise, it
is silent.

The result is saved to the window stack for future chained commands. See
L<WINDOW STACK> and L<COMMAND CHAINING> for details.

The options available are:

=over

=item B<--class> 

Match against the window class.

=item B<--classname> 

Match against the window classname.

=item B<--maxdepth> N 

Set recursion/child search depth. Default is -1,
meaning infinite. 0 means no depth, aka no results. If you only want toplevel
windows, set maxdepth of 1.

=item B<--name>

Match against the window name. This is the same string that is displayed in the
window titlebar.

=item B<--onlyvisible> 

Show only visible windows in the results. This means ones with map state
IsViewable.

=item B<--pid PID> 

Match windows that belong to a specific process id. This may not work for some
X applications that do not set this metadata on its windows.

=item B<--screen N>

Select windows only on a specific screen. Default is to
search all screens. Only meaningful if you have multiple displays and are not
using Xinerama.

=item B<--title> 

DEPRECATED. See --name.

=item B<--all>

Require that all conditions be met. For example:

 xdotool search --all --pid 1424 --name "Hello World"

This will match only windows that have "Hello World" as a name and are owned by
pid 1424.

=item B<--any>

Match windows that match any condition (logically, 'or'). This is on by
default. For example:

 xdotool search --any --pid 1424 --name "Hello World"

This will match any windows owned by pid 1424 or windows with name "Hello
World"

=back

The default options are C<--name --class --classname>

=item B<getwindowpid> I<[window=%1]>

Output the PID owning a given window. This requires effort from the application
owning a window and may not work for all windows. This uses _NET_WM_PID
property of the window. See L<EXTENDED WINDOW MANAGER HINTS> below for more
information.

If no window is given, the default is '%1'. If no windows are on the stack, then
this is an error. See L<WINDOW STACK> for more details.

Example: Find the PID for all xterms:
 xdotool search --class xterm getwindowpid %@

=item B<getwindowfocus> [-f]

Prints the window id of the currently focused window. Saves the result to the
window stack. See L<WINDOW STACK> for more details.

If the current window has no WM_CLASS property, we assume it is not a normal
top-level window and traverse up the parents until we find a window with a
WM_CLASS set and return that window id.

If you really want the window currently having focus and don't care if it has a
WM_CLASS setting, then use 'getwindowfocus -f'

=item B<windowsize> [options] [window=%1] width height

Set the window size of the given window. If no window is given, %1 is the
default.  See L<WINDOW STACK> and L<COMMAND CHAINING> for more details.

The options available are:

=over

=item B<--usehints> 

Use window sizing hints (when available) to set width and height.  This is
useful on terminals for setting the size based on row/column of text rather
than pixels.

=item B<--sync> 

After sending the window size request, wait until the window is actually
resized. If no change is necessary, we will not wait. This is useful for
scripts that depend on actions being completed before moving on.

Note: Because many window managers may ignore or alter the original resize
request, we will wait until the size changes from its original size, not 
necessary to the requested size.

=back

Example: To set a terminal to be 80x24 characters, you would use:
 xdotool windowsize --usehints I<some_windowid> 80 24

=item B<windowmove> I<[options]> I<[window=%1]> I<x> I<y>

Move the window to the given position. If no window is given, %1 is the
default. See L<WINDOW STACK> and L<COMMAND CHAINING> for more details.

=over

=item B<--sync> 

After sending the window move request, wait until the window is actually
moved. If no movement is necessary, we will not wait. This is useful for
scripts that depend on actions being completed before moving on.

=back


=item B<windowfocus> I<[options]> I<[window=%1]>

Focus a window. If no window is given, %1 is the default. See L<WINDOW STACK>
and L<COMMAND CHAINING> for more details.

Uses L<XSetInputFocus> which may be ignored by some window managers or programs.

=over

=item B<--sync> 

After sending the window focus request, wait until the window is actually
focused. This is useful for scripts that depend on actions being completed
before moving on.

=back


=item B<windowmap> I<[options]> I<[window=%1]>

Map a window. In X11 terminology, mapping a window means making it visible on
the screen. If no window is given, %1 is the default. See L<WINDOW STACK> and
L<COMMAND CHAINING> for more details.


=over

=item B<--sync> 

After requesting the window map, wait until the window is actually mapped
(visible). This is useful for scripts that depend on actions being completed
before moving on.

=back

=item B<windowraise> I<window_id>

Raise the window to the top of the stack. This may not work on all window managers.

=item B<windowunmap> I<window_id>

Unmap a window, making it no longer appear on your screen.

=over

=item B<--sync> 

After requesting the window unmap, wait until the window is actually unmapped
(hidden). This is useful for scripts that depend on actions being completed
before moving on.

=back

=item B<set_window> I<[options]> I<windowid>

Set properties about a window.

Options:

=over

=item B<--name newname> 

Set window WM_NAME (the window title, usually)

=item B<--icon-name newiconname> 

Set window WM_ICON_NAME (the window title when minimized, usually)

=item B<--role newrole>

Set window WM_WINDOW_ROLE

=item B<--classname newclassname>

Set window class name (not to be confused with window class)

=item B<--class newclass>

Set window class (not to be confused with window class name)

=back

=back

=head1 DESKTOP AND WINDOW COMMANDS

These commands follow the EWMH standard. See the section L<EXTENDED WINDOW
MANAGER HINTS> for more information.

=over 

=item B<windowactivate> I<[options]> I<windowid>

Activate the window. This command is different from windowfocus:
if the window is on another desktop, we will switch to that desktop. It also
uses a different method for bringing the window up. I recommend trying this
command before using windowfocus, as it will work on more window managers.

=over

=item B<--sync> 

After sending the window activation, wait until the window is actually
activated. This is useful for scripts that depend on actions being completed
before moving on.

=back

=item B<getactivewindow>

Output the current active window. This command is often more reliable than
getwindowfocus. The result is saved to the window stack. See L<WINDOW STACK>
for more details.

=item B<set_num_desktops> I<number>

Changes the number of desktops or workspaces.

=item B<get_num_desktops>

Output the current number of desktops.

=item B<set_desktop> I<desktop_number>

Change the current view to the specified desktop.

=item B<get_desktop>

Output the current desktop in view.

=item B<set_desktop_for_window> I<window_id> I<desktop_number>

Move a window to a different desktop.

=item B<get_desktop_for_window> I<window_id>

Output the desktop currently containing the given window.

=back

=head1 SCRIPTS

xdotool can read a list of commands via stdin or a file if you want. A script
will fail when any command fails.

=over

=item * Read commands from a file:

 xdotool filename

=item * Read commands from stdin:

 xdotool -

=item * Read commands from a redirected file

 xdotool - < myfile

=back

You can also write scripts that only execute xdotool. Example:

 #!/usr/local/bin/xdotool
 windowactivate $WINDOWID
 mousemove -window $WINDOWID 50 50
 click 1
 click 1

All commands are run as if you had typed 'xdotool <line>' via /bin/sh. This
means any shell magic should work here, too, including the use of environment
variables. For above, here's how you'd set the value of WINDOWID:

 % WINDOWID=1234 ./myscript

=head1 CLEARMODIFIERS

Any command taking the I<--clearmodifiers> flag will attempt to clear any
active input modifiers during the command and restore them afterwards.

For example, if you were to run this command:
 xdotool key a

The result would be 'a' or 'A' depending on whether or not you were holding the
shift key on your keyboard. Often it is undesirable to have any modifiers
active, so you can tell xdotool to clear any active modifiers. 

The order of operations if you hold shift while running 'xdotool key --clearmodifiers a' is this:

=over

=item 1. Query for all active modifiers (finds shift, in this case)

=item 2. Try to clear shift by sending 'key up' for the shift key

=item 3. Runs normal 'xdotool key a'

=item 4. Restore shift key by sending 'key down' for shift

=back

The I<--clearmodifiers> flag can currently clear of the following:

=over

=item * any key in your active keymap that has a modifier associated with it.
(See L<xmodmap(1)>'s 'xmodmap -pm' output)

=item * mouse buttons (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)

=item * caps lock


=back

=head1 SENDEVENT NOTES

If you are trying to send key input to a specific window, and it does not
appear to be working, then it's likely your application is ignoring the events
xdotool is generating. This is fairly common.

Sending keystrokes to a specific window uses a different API than simply typing
to the active window. If you specify 'xdotool type --window 12345 hello'
xdotool will generate key events and send them directly to window 12345.
However, X11 servers will set a special flag on all events generated in this
way (see XEvent.xany.send_event in X11's manual). Many programs observe this
flag and reject these events.

It is important to note that for key and mouse events, we only use
L<XSendEvent> when a specific window is targeted. Otherwise, we use L<XTEST>.

Some programs can be configured to accept events even if they are generated by
xdotool. Seek the documentation of your application for help.

Specific application notes (from the author's testing):
* Firefox 3 seems to ignore all input when it does not have focus.
* xterm can be configured while running with ctrl+leftclick, 'Allow SendEvents'
* gnome-terminal appears to accept generated input by default.

=head1 WINDOW STACK

Certain commands (search, getactivewindow, getwindowfocus) will find windows
for you. These results generally printed to stdout, but they are also saved
to memory for future use during the lifetime of the xdotool process. See
L<COMMAND CHAINING> for more information.

The only modifications support for the window stack are to replace it. That is,
two of two sequential searches, only the last one's results will be the window
stack.

=head1 COMMAND CHAINING

xdotool supports running multiple commands on a single invocation. Generally,
you'll start with a search command (see L<WINDOW STACK>) and then perform a 
set of actions on those results.

To query the window stack, you can use special notation "%N" where N is a
number or the '@' symbol. If %N is given, the Nth window will be selected from
the window stack. Generally you will only want the first one as the order of
the windows in the stack is unreliable (See L<XQueryTree> for ordering details).
If you specify '%@' then all windows in the stack will be used.

The notation described above is used as the "window" argument for any given
command.

For example, to resize all xterms to 80x24:

 xdotool search --class xterm -- windowsize --usehints 80 24

Resize move the current window:

 xdotool getactivewindow windowmove 0 0

In all cases, the default window argument, if omitted, will default to "%1". It is
obviously an error if you omit the window argument and the window stack is empty. If you
try to use the window stack and it is empty, it is also an error.

To activate the first firefox window found:

 xdotool search --class firefox windowactivate

These would error:

 xdotool windowactivate
 xdotool windowactivate %1
 xdotool windowactivate %@

When xdotool exits, the current window stack is lost.

Additinally, commands that modify the L<WINDOW STACK> will not print the
results if they are not the last command. For example:

 # Output the active window:
 % xdotool getactivewindow 
 20971533

 # Output the pid of the active window, but not the active window id:
 % xdotool getactivewindow getwindowpid
 4686

=head1 EXTENDED WINDOW MANAGER HINTS

The following pieces of the EWMH standard are supported:

=over 

=item _NET_SUPPORTED

Asks the window manager what is supported

=item _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP

Query and set the current desktop. Support for this enables these commands:
C<set_desktop>, C<get_desktop>.

=item _NET_WM_DESKTOP

Query and set what desktop a window is living in. Support for this enables
these commands: C<set_desktop_for_window>, C<get_desktop_for_window>.

=item _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW

Allows you to query and set the active window by asking the window manager to
bring it forward. Support for this enables these commands: C<windowactivate>, C<getactivewindow>.

=item _NET_WM_PID

This feature is application dependent, not window-manager dependent. Query the
PID owning a given window. Support for this enables these commands:
C<getwindowpid>.
