Unfortunately wayland is incompatible in almost every way with xdotool. Even attempting to write a similar tool for Wayland may not be possible
because similar capabilities do not exist in Wayland or its ecosystem :(

xdotool: Fake input from the mouse and keyboard very easily.
  Also supports window manager actions such as moving, activating, and other
  actions on windows.
libxdo: C library for doing the same.

See the website for more up-to-date documentation

  or the manpage listed below.

Compile: make
Install: make install
Remove: make uninstall

You may have to set 'PREFIX' to the location you want to install to. 
The default PREFIX is /usr/local

For packagers, there's also support for DESTDIR for staged install.

Also, see the manpage, which you can generate by running:
  make showman
Note: the manpage will be installed during 'make install'
